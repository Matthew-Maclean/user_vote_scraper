# User Vote Scraper (for reddit)

Scrapes a user's posts and comments to find which ones you have voted on.  
Ever use RES and see a `[+10]` next to someones name, and wonder which of their posts you voted on?  
This tool will do that for you.

Due to reddit api limitations, this program can only scrape at most 50 posts and comments per second. or 100 per second if you only scrape one of posts or comments.  
If the user you are scraping has more than a combined 180,000 posts and comments, or more than 360,000 of either posts or comments, this program may fail.
