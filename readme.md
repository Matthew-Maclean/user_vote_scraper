# User Vote Scraper (for reddit)

Scrapes a user's posts and comments to find which ones you have voted on.  
Ever use RES and see a `[+10]` next to someones name, and wonder which of their posts you voted on?  
This tool will do that for you.

Due to reddit API limitations, this program can only scrape a maximum of 25 posts/second.
